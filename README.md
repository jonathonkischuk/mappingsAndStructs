# mappingsAndStructs
Uses mappings and structs to preform basic send and withdrawal functionality.


This code uses mapping and struct to create more dynamic functionality, allowing the contract to track who is sending what.
Also, while this contract allows us to send and withdraw all money, it has an added function.
This time we are also able to withdraw money without having to withdraw the entire amount.
Finally, our contract keeps track of the balance.

Note: Our withdrawAllMoney function follows the Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern to avoid issues.
